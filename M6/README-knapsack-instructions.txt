Module 6, Knapsack Algorithm Assignment:

Attached you will find two files.
File 1: The “knapsack-template.py” file is a Python script that will give you the optimal solution to a given Knapsack Problem by using complete enumeration (i.e., trying all the different combinations). For the small data sets, this script will work quickly. However, as data sets get larger (n > 20), then it will take a long time to run.

File 2: The “knapsack-data-sets.txt” file contains a number of data sets to test your algorithm in the same needed as the format as the template. Note, the first 10 data sets (Initial through Data Set 9) take less than a second to run on Dr. Wilck’s machine using the template algorithm. However, Data Set 10 takes approximately 30 seconds using the template algorithm.

Your assignment is to create different knapsack algorithms to improve efficiency and not use complete enumeration, but being more systematic.

Submit your final Python file with your preferred algorithm on Canvas – using the same data structure as provided to you in the data sets. It will be graded for accuracy and speed on Dr. Wilck’s machine, and compared against your peers (as defined in the rubric).

Ignore all other instructions on the course website regarding setting up a file server.

Sincerely, Joe Wilck
