Module 6, Bin Packing Algorithm Assignment:

Attached you will find two files.
File 1: The “binpack-template.py” file is a Python script that needs work in order to provide a solution to the Bin Packing problem.  You should focus your efforts on adjusting the script starting with line 96.  Note, this template file is arranged to run all of the data sets in the following JSON file.

File 2: The “binpack.json” file contains a number of data sets to test your algorithm. The above template code will test all of these data sets in succession (at the same time, one after the other, etc.).

Your assignment is to create different bin packing algorithms to improve accuracy (optimality - that is - using the least number of bins to store all of the items) and efficiency (speed).

Submit your final Python file with your preferred algorithm on Canvas – changing only the area (binpack function) in the template code and maintaining the same data structure. It will be graded for accuracy and speed on Dr. Wilck’s machine, and compared against your peers (as defined in the rubric).

Ignore all other instructions on the course website regarding setting up a file server.

Sincerely, Joe Wilck
